## Election Audit Summary

   For this script to be used for any election in the future, few things need to be modified:
   
   First, make sure to import the correct dependencies, open the right file folder and names, and write to the correct text folder and file names. See the image below.
   
   ![election script](https://github.com/summerginger/Election_Analysis/blob/main/election%20script.png)
   
   Second, if more column is added or removed in the file, make sure the loop running throw each row for that column number is correct.
   
   ![colunm number](https://github.com/summerginger/Election_Analysis/blob/main/column%20number.png) 
   
   Last, for loop and conditional if statement, all the request variable needs to be consistency.
